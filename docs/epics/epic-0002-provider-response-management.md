# Epic 0002: Comprehensive Provider Response Management

## Epic Overview

**Epic Title:** Comprehensive Provider Response Management

**Problem Statement:**
The current unified model approach in LLMgine leads to significant data loss when converting provider-specific responses to a common format. Each provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) returns unique metadata, usage statistics, and response structures that are discarded during the normalization process. This loss of provider-specific information limits observability, prevents accurate cost tracking, and constrains advanced features that could leverage provider-specific capabilities.

## Stories

### Story 2.1: Response Recording Framework
**Summary:** Implement a ResponseRecorder class that captures complete provider responses before any transformation, storing them in a structured format that preserves all original data while maintaining the unified interface.

### Story 2.2: Base Response Models Redesign
**Summary:** Redesign the base response models to support provider-specific data preservation while maintaining backward compatibility with the unified interface, establishing the foundation for provider-specific implementations.

### Story 2.3: OpenAI Provider Response Implementation
**Summary:** Implement comprehensive response handling for OpenAI, including deep API research, response recording analysis, and complete field mapping for all OpenAI-specific features and metadata.

### Story 2.4: Anthropic Provider Response Implementation
**Summary:** Implement comprehensive response handling for Anthropic, including deep API research, response recording analysis, and complete field mapping for all Anthropic-specific features and metadata.

### Story 2.5: Gemini Provider Response Implementation
**Summary:** Implement comprehensive response handling for Gemini, including deep API research, response recording analysis, and complete field mapping for all Gemini-specific features and metadata.

### Story 2.6: OpenRouter Provider Response Implementation
**Summary:** Implement comprehensive response handling for OpenRouter, including deep API research, response recording analysis, and complete field mapping for all OpenRouter-specific features and metadata.

### Story 2.7: Migration and Cleanup
**Summary:** Migrate existing code to use the new response management system, clean up deprecated code, update all tests and documentation, and ensure smooth transition for all consumers of the API.

## Success Criteria

1. **Zero Data Loss**: All provider response data is captured and stored without any loss of information
2. **Performance Impact**: Response recording adds less than 5ms latency to LLM calls
3. **Storage Efficiency**: Recorded responses use efficient serialization with optional compression
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without modification
5. **Provider Coverage**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini providers at launch
6. **Observability**: Full integration with existing event system and observability tools
7. **Cost Accuracy**: Cost calculations match provider billing within 0.1% margin
8. **Testing**: 95%+ code coverage with comprehensive test scenarios

## Technical Considerations

- Must integrate seamlessly with existing message bus architecture
- Should leverage existing Pydantic models where possible
- Need to consider memory usage for high-volume applications
- Storage backend should be pluggable (memory, disk, database)
- Must handle streaming responses appropriately

## Dependencies

- Existing observability framework (Epic 0001)
- Current provider implementations
- Message bus system
- Pydantic for data modeling

## Timeline Estimates

- **Story 2.1**: 3-4 days (Response Recording Framework)
- **Story 2.2**: 2-3 days (Base Response Models Redesign)
- **Story 2.3**: 3-4 days (OpenAI Provider Response)
- **Story 2.4**: 3-4 days (Anthropic Provider Response)
- **Story 2.5**: 3-4 days (Gemini Provider Response)
- **Story 2.6**: 3-4 days (OpenRouter Provider Response)
- **Story 2.7**: 2-3 days (Migration and Cleanup)

**Total Estimated Time**: 19-26 days

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Risk**: Storage overhead for high-volume applications
   - **Mitigation**: Implement configurable retention policies and compression

2. **Risk**: Breaking changes to provider APIs
   - **Mitigation**: Version response models and maintain backward compatibility

3. **Risk**: Performance degradation
   - **Mitigation**: Async recording, optional sampling, and performance benchmarks
