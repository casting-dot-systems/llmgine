# Next Steps

1. Review and validate this Brownfield PRD against current codebase reality
2. Prioritize stories based on impact and dependencies
3. Begin implementation with Story 1.1 (OpenTelemetry) as it's the most critical gap
4. Establish testing patterns early (Story 1.3) to ensure quality throughout
5. Plan for gradual rollout with feature flags where appropriate
