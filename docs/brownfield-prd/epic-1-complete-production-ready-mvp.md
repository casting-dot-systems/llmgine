# Epic 1: Complete Production-Ready MVP

**Epic Goal**: Implement the remaining MVP requirements from the original PRD - OpenTelemetry observability, standardized LLM contracts, and comprehensive test coverage - to achieve true production readiness.

**Integration Requirements**: All enhancements must integrate seamlessly with existing components without breaking changes. Priority on maintaining backward compatibility while adding new capabilities.

## Story 1.1: Implement OpenTelemetry Event Handler

As a platform engineer,
I want OpenTelemetry integration for the observability system,
so that I can monitor llmgine applications in production environments.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create `OpenTelemetryEventHandler` class that extends `ObservabilityEventHandler`
2. Implement event-to-span conversion following OTel semantic conventions
3. Configure OTLP exporter with customizable endpoint
4. Add OpenTelemetry dependencies as optional extra in pyproject.toml
5. Create configuration integration with ApplicationBootstrap
6. Document OTel setup and configuration options

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing FileEventHandler and ConsoleEventHandler continue to work unchanged
- IV2: Message bus event publishing performance remains unaffected
- IV3: Applications without OTel dependencies can still run normally

## Story 1.2: Standardize LLM Request Contract

As a developer,
I want a standardized LLMRequest contract across all providers,
so that I can switch providers without changing my application code.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create `LLMRequest` base class in `src/llmgine/messages/`
2. Define common fields: messages, model, temperature, max_tokens, tools
3. Update all provider implementations to accept LLMRequest
4. Maintain backward compatibility with provider-specific requests
5. Create request transformation utilities for each provider
6. Update example programs to use standardized requests

### Integration Verification
- IV1: All existing provider calls continue to work with current interfaces
- IV2: Provider-specific features remain accessible through extensions
- IV3: No performance degradation in request processing

## Story 1.3: Comprehensive Test Coverage - Core Components

As a maintainer,
I want comprehensive test coverage for core components,
so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions early.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Achieve >80% test coverage for message bus components
2. Add integration tests for complete command/event flows
3. Create comprehensive tests for all observability handlers
4. Test error handling and edge cases in bus operations
5. Add performance benchmarks for critical paths
6. Set up coverage reporting in CI pipeline

### Integration Verification
- IV1: All existing tests continue to pass
- IV2: Test execution time remains under 5 minutes
- IV3: Tests can run in isolation without external dependencies

## Story 1.4: Comprehensive Test Coverage - Providers and Tools

As a maintainer,
I want comprehensive test coverage for LLM providers and tools,
so that I can ensure reliable interactions with external services.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create unit tests for all provider implementations
2. Add mock-based tests for provider API calls
3. Test tool registration and execution flows
4. Create integration tests for tool + provider interactions
5. Test error handling for API failures and rate limits
6. Document testing patterns for community contributors

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Tests work with both real and mocked providers
- IV2: No API keys required for basic test execution
- IV3: Provider-specific features are properly tested

## Story 1.5: Final Integration and Documentation

As a developer,
I want complete documentation and examples for the MVP features,
so that I can quickly build production applications with llmgine.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create comprehensive README with all MVP features
2. Add OpenTelemetry configuration guide
3. Document provider contract migration process
4. Create production deployment guide
5. Update all example programs with best practices
6. Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

### Integration Verification
- IV1: All example programs work with new features
- IV2: Documentation accurately reflects current implementation
- IV3: Quick start guide gets users running in <10 minutes
