# Requirements

## Functional

1. **FR1**: The library must implement a standalone observability module separate from the message bus that captures events without creating circular dependencies.
2. **FR2**: The observability module must support pluggable handlers including OpenTelemetry, file, and console outputs.
3. **FR3**: The library must define a standardized `LLMRequest` contract that all providers implement.
4. **FR4**: The library must achieve comprehensive test coverage (>80%) for all core components.
5. **FR5**: All provider implementations must be updated to use the standardized contracts.
6. **FR6**: The message bus must integrate with the observability module to automatically log events without publishing observability events back to the bus.
7. **FR7**: The message bus must be enhanced with production-grade robustness features including error recovery, backpressure handling, and dead letter queues.
8. **FR8**: The message bus must include comprehensive performance benchmarks and stress tests to ensure scalability.

## Non-Functional

1. **NFR1**: The OpenTelemetry integration must follow OTel semantic conventions for LLM applications.
2. **NFR2**: Test execution time must remain under 5 minutes for the full test suite.
3. **NFR3**: The standardized contracts must not break existing provider implementations.
4. **NFR4**: OpenTelemetry integration must be optional and not affect performance when disabled.
5. **NFR5**: All new code must maintain the existing code quality standards (Ruff, MyPy strict).
6. **NFR6**: The message bus must handle 10,000+ events/second with <10ms p99 latency under normal load.
7. **NFR7**: The message bus must gracefully degrade under extreme load without data loss or crashes.

## Compatibility Requirements

1. **CR1**: All existing provider APIs must continue to function without breaking changes.
2. **CR2**: The message bus event structure must remain compatible with existing handlers.
3. **CR3**: CLI interfaces and commands must maintain backward compatibility.
4. **CR4**: Existing example programs must continue to work without modification.
