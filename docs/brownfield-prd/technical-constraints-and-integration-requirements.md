# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Python 3.11+
**Frameworks**: Async/await patterns, Pydantic for data models
**Database**: In-memory stores, optional SQLite for persistence
**Infrastructure**: Docker-first deployment, uv for package management
**External Dependencies**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini SDKs, Rich for CLI

## Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: No changes required - existing in-memory and SQLite patterns remain
**API Integration Strategy**: Add standardized request contract as base class for provider-specific implementations
**Frontend Integration Strategy**: N/A for MVP (React observability GUI is post-MVP)
**Testing Integration Strategy**: Extend existing pytest framework with comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow existing modular structure - add otel handler in `src/llmgine/observability/`
**Naming Conventions**: Maintain existing patterns - CamelCase for classes, snake_case for functions
**Coding Standards**: Ruff with 90-character line limit, MyPy strict mode
**Documentation Standards**: Docstrings for all public APIs, type hints throughout

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Update pyproject.toml with OpenTelemetry dependencies as optional extra
**Deployment Strategy**: No changes - maintain existing Docker and pip installation methods
**Monitoring and Logging**: OpenTelemetry will enhance existing file/console logging
**Configuration Management**: Add OTel configuration to existing settings system

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: OpenTelemetry SDK compatibility across Python versions
**Integration Risks**: Provider contract changes could affect downstream users
**Deployment Risks**: Additional dependencies may increase deployment complexity
**Mitigation Strategies**: 
- Make OpenTelemetry an optional dependency
- Provide migration guide for contract changes
- Extensive testing before release
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
