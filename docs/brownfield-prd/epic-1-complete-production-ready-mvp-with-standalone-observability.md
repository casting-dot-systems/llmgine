# Epic 1: Complete Production-Ready MVP with Standalone Observability

**Epic Goal**: Implement the remaining MVP requirements from the original PRD with an improved architecture - standalone observability module with OpenTelemetry support, standardized LLM contracts, and comprehensive test coverage - to achieve true production readiness.

**Integration Requirements**: All enhancements must integrate seamlessly with existing components without breaking changes. Priority on maintaining backward compatibility while adding new capabilities.

## Story 1.1: Implement Standalone Observability Module

As a platform engineer,
I want a separate observability module that doesn't depend on the message bus,
so that I can monitor all events without creating circular dependencies or performance overhead.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create standalone `ObservabilityManager` that intercepts events without using the message bus
2. Refactor existing handlers to work with the new observability module
3. Implement `OpenTelemetryHandler` for OTel integration
4. Add OpenTelemetry dependencies as optional extra in pyproject.toml
5. Update message bus to call observability module directly (not via events)
6. Ensure no observability events are published back to the message bus
7. Document the new observability architecture

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Message bus continues to function without observability-triggered events
- IV2: All events are still captured by observability handlers
- IV3: No circular dependencies between bus and observability
- IV4: Performance improves due to reduced event overhead

## Story 1.2: Enhance Message Bus Robustness

As a platform engineer,
I want a production-grade message bus with error recovery and performance guarantees,
so that I can build reliable applications that scale under load.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement error recovery mechanisms for handler failures
2. Add backpressure handling to prevent queue overflow
3. Create dead letter queue for unprocessable events
4. Add circuit breaker pattern for failing handlers
5. Implement event prioritization and queue management
6. Add comprehensive logging and metrics for bus operations
7. Create performance benchmarks targeting 10k events/sec

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing handler registration and execution continues to work
- IV2: No performance degradation for normal workloads
- IV3: Graceful degradation under extreme load
- IV4: All existing tests continue to pass

## Story 1.3: Standardize LLM Request Contract

As a developer,
I want a standardized LLMRequest contract across all providers,
so that I can switch providers without changing my application code.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create `LLMRequest` base class in `src/llmgine/messages/`
2. Define common fields: messages, model, temperature, max_tokens, tools
3. Update all provider implementations to accept LLMRequest
4. Maintain backward compatibility with provider-specific requests
5. Create request transformation utilities for each provider
6. Update example programs to use standardized requests

### Integration Verification
- IV1: All existing provider calls continue to work with current interfaces
- IV2: Provider-specific features remain accessible through extensions
- IV3: No performance degradation in request processing

## Story 1.4: Comprehensive Test Coverage - Core Components with Performance

As a maintainer,
I want comprehensive test coverage and performance benchmarks for core components,
so that I can ensure reliability and maintain performance SLAs.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Achieve >80% test coverage for message bus components
2. Add integration tests for complete command/event flows
3. Create comprehensive tests for all observability handlers
4. Test error handling and edge cases in bus operations
5. Add performance benchmarks achieving 10k events/sec target
6. Create stress tests for graceful degradation scenarios
7. Add chaos testing for handler failures and recovery
8. Set up continuous performance monitoring in CI

### Integration Verification
- IV1: All existing tests continue to pass
- IV2: Test execution time remains under 5 minutes
- IV3: Tests can run in isolation without external dependencies

## Story 1.5: Comprehensive Test Coverage - Providers and Tools

As a maintainer,
I want comprehensive test coverage for LLM providers and tools,
so that I can ensure reliable interactions with external services.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create unit tests for all provider implementations
2. Add mock-based tests for provider API calls
3. Test tool registration and execution flows
4. Create integration tests for tool + provider interactions
5. Test error handling for API failures and rate limits
6. Document testing patterns for community contributors

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Tests work with both real and mocked providers
- IV2: No API keys required for basic test execution
- IV3: Provider-specific features are properly tested

## Story 1.6: Final Integration and Documentation

As a developer,
I want complete documentation and examples for the MVP features,
so that I can quickly build production applications with llmgine.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create comprehensive README with all MVP features
2. Add OpenTelemetry configuration guide
3. Document provider contract migration process
4. Create production deployment guide
5. Update all example programs with best practices
6. Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

### Integration Verification
- IV1: All example programs work with new features
- IV2: Documentation accurately reflects current implementation
- IV3: Quick start guide gets users running in <10 minutes
