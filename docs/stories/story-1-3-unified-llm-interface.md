# Story 1.3: Unified LLM Interface

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

As a developer using `llmgine`,
I want to refactor the existing unified LLM implementation into a modular architecture with canonical data models and provider-specific adapters,
so that I can either use a unified interface for portability OR access providers directly for full features.

## Context

**Current Implementation Status:**
The dev has already implemented a working unified LLM interface in `src/llmgine/unified/` with:
- `UnifiedMessage`, `UnifiedRequest`, `UnifiedResponse` models in `base.py`
- Working adapters for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini in `adapters.py`
- `UnifiedLLMClient` in `client.py` with automatic provider detection
- 48 passing tests and live API verification
- Example scripts demonstrating various use cases

**Architecture Change Decision:**
After the initial implementation, the architect (Winston) has redesigned the architecture to be more modular and extensible. The new architecture maintains the Unified* naming while reorganizing the code into a cleaner modular structure with separate provider implementations and an orchestrator layer.

**API Research (January 2025):**

**OpenAI Chat Completions API:**
- Uses `messages` array with roles: "system", "user", "assistant"
- Stateless - requires full conversation history
- Supports multimodal content blocks

**Anthropic Claude Messages API:**
- Uses `messages` array with roles: "user", "assistant"
- System prompt is a separate field (not in messages)
- Content can be string or array of content blocks
- Requires specific headers: `x-api-key`, `anthropic-version`

**Google Gemini API (AI Studio):**
- Uses `contents` array with `parts` inside
- Roles are "user" and "model" (not "assistant")
- Supports structured output with response schemas
- Uses simple API key authentication (not Vertex AI)

**New Architecture Goals:**
- **Unified Models**: Keep `Unified*` class names but reorganize into cleaner structure
- **Provider Modules**: Extract provider-specific code from unified implementation
- **Orchestrator**: Move unified client to orchestrator layer  
- **Dual Access**: Enable both unified (portable) and direct (full-featured) access patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Reorganize unified data models while keeping their names:
   - Move `UnifiedMessage` from base.py to models.py (no rename)
   - Move `UnifiedRequest` from base.py to models.py (no rename)
   - Move `UnifiedResponse` from base.py to models.py (no rename)
   - Preserve all existing functionality during reorganization
2. Extract provider-specific code from `src/llmgine/unified/adapters.py` into modular packages:
   - Create `src/llmgine/providers/openai/` with client and adapter
   - Create `src/llmgine/providers/anthropic/` with client and adapter
   - Create `src/llmgine/providers/gemini/` with client and adapter
   - Each provider gets its own models, client, and adapter
3. Build orchestrator in `src/llmgine/orchestrator/` for unified access:
   - Move `UnifiedLLMClient` from `src/llmgine/unified/client.py`
   - Update imports to use reorganized unified models
   - Update to use new provider adapters
4. Support dual access patterns:
   - Direct: `providers.openai.OpenAIClient()` for all provider features
   - Unified: `orchestrator.UnifiedLLMClient()` for portable code
5. Ensure all existing tests continue to pass after refactoring
6. Update existing examples to use new import paths
7. Create migration guide for users of current unified interface
8. Document the new architecture and both access patterns

## Integration Verification

- IV1: Live API calls work correctly for all three providers
- IV2: Provider switching requires only model name change
- IV3: Streaming responses work across all providers
- IV4: Error handling is consistent across providers

## Technical Details

### Migration from Current Implementation

**Current Structure (Already Implemented):**
```
src/llmgine/unified/
├── __init__.py
├── base.py          # UnifiedMessage, UnifiedRequest, UnifiedResponse
├── adapters.py      # to_openai_format(), to_anthropic_format(), to_gemini_format()
└── client.py        # UnifiedLLMClient
```

**Target Structure (After Restructuring):**
```
src/llmgine/
├── unified/               # Unified models location
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── models.py          # UnifiedMessage, UnifiedRequest, UnifiedResponse (moved from base.py)
├── providers/             # Extracted from adapters.py
│   ├── openai/
│   │   ├── client.py      # Direct OpenAI client
│   │   └── adapter.py     # OpenAI adapter logic
│   ├── anthropic/
│   │   ├── client.py      # Direct Anthropic client
│   │   └── adapter.py     # Anthropic adapter logic
│   └── gemini/
│       ├── client.py      # Direct Gemini client
│       └── adapter.py     # Gemini adapter logic
└── orchestrator/          # New location for unified client
    └── client.py          # UnifiedLLMClient (moved from unified/client.py)
```

### Unified Data Models (No Renaming)

```python
# src/llmgine/unified/models.py
# These are the EXISTING models, just relocated from base.py
class UnifiedMessage:  # Keep existing name
    role: Literal["system", "user", "assistant"]
    content: Union[str, List[ContentBlock]]

class ContentBlock:  # No change
    type: Literal["text", "image", "file"]
    text: Optional[str]
    image_url: Optional[str]
    image_base64: Optional[str]
    mime_type: Optional[str]

class UnifiedRequest:  # Keep existing name
    model: str
    messages: List[UnifiedMessage]
    max_tokens: Optional[int]
    temperature: Optional[float]
    system: Optional[str]  # Extracted for providers that need it
    stream: bool = False
    
class UnifiedResponse:  # Keep existing name
    content: str
    usage: Optional[Dict[str, int]]
    model: str
    finish_reason: Optional[str]
    raw_response: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
```

### Modular Provider Architecture

**Each provider module contains:**

```python
# src/llmgine/providers/{provider}/
├── __init__.py
├── client.py      # Direct API client with full features
├── adapter.py     # Bidirectional canonical ↔ provider adapter
└── models.py      # Provider-specific request/response models
```

**Adapter Interface:**

```python
class ProviderAdapter(ABC):
    def to_provider_request(self, unified: UnifiedRequest) -> ProviderRequest
    def from_provider_response(self, response: ProviderResponse) -> UnifiedResponse
    def to_provider_stream_request(self, unified: UnifiedRequest) -> ProviderStreamRequest
    def from_provider_stream_chunk(self, chunk: ProviderChunk) -> UnifiedStreamChunk
```

**Provider Examples:**

- **OpenAI**: Full chat completions API, tools, vision, etc.
- **Anthropic**: Messages API, vision, system prompts, beta features
- **Gemini**: Contents/parts, structured output, safety settings

### Key Architecture Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Each provider is self-contained - add new ones without touching existing code
2. **Flexibility**: Use unified interface OR direct provider access as needed
3. **Maintainability**: Provider-specific logic isolated in provider modules
4. **Type Safety**: Unified models provide consistent types across providers
5. **Feature Access**: Direct clients expose ALL provider features, not just common subset
6. **Testing**: Test adapters independently from clients
7. **Migration Path**: Easy to start unified, then use direct access for advanced features

### Implementation Guidance

The dev should restructure the existing working implementation into the new modular architecture:

1. **Phase 1 - Reorganize Models**:
   - Move `unified/base.py` → `unified/models.py` (simple rename)
   - Update unified/__init__.py exports
   - Run tests to verify nothing breaks

2. **Phase 2 - Extract Provider Modules**:
   - Create `src/llmgine/providers/` directory structure
   - Extract provider logic from `unified/adapters.py` into provider modules
   - Each provider gets its own adapter.py and client.py

3. **Phase 3 - Move Client to Orchestrator**:
   - Create `src/llmgine/orchestrator/` 
   - Move `unified/client.py` → `orchestrator/client.py`
   - Update imports to use unified/models.py and new providers

4. **Phase 4 - Clean Up**:
   - Remove old files (base.py, adapters.py, old client.py)
   - Update all imports in tests and examples
   - Verify all tests still pass

## Dev Notes

### Implementation History
- Initial implementation completed with Unified* classes in src/llmgine/unified/
- All tests passing, live API calls working
- Architecture review resulted in restructuring for better modularity
- Important: The implementation is correct, just needs reorganization
- Keep all existing class names (UnifiedMessage, UnifiedRequest, UnifiedResponse)

### Restructuring Guidelines
- This is a pure restructuring - no logic changes needed
- Use git mv to preserve file history
- Run tests after each move to ensure nothing breaks
- The implementation is already correct, we're just organizing it better

### Technical Considerations
- Each provider module should be self-contained
- Direct clients should expose ALL provider features, not just common subset
- Adapters handle ALL differences between unified and provider formats
- Unified models should support common features across providers
- Provider-specific features accessible only through direct clients
- Continue using direct HTTP calls via httpx, not provider SDKs
- All testing must use live API calls, no mocking
- API keys via environment variables: OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY
- Future providers should just add a new folder under providers/

```

### Key Components

#### 1. Base Models (`base.py`)

- **UnifiedMessage**: Standardizes messages across providers with role and content
- **ContentBlock**: Supports text, images, and files in a unified format
- **UnifiedRequest**: Common request format with all shared parameters
- **UnifiedResponse**: Normalized response format with content, usage, etc.
- **UnifiedStreamChunk**: For handling streaming responses

The response classes include `from_openai()`, `from_anthropic()`, and `from_gemini()` class methods to convert provider-specific responses to our unified format.

#### 2. Adapters (`adapters.py`)

Contains three main converter functions:

- **to_openai_format()**: Converts UnifiedRequest → OpenAI format
  - Handles system messages in the messages array
  - Converts content blocks to OpenAI's multimodal format
- **to_anthropic_format()**: Converts UnifiedRequest → Anthropic format
  - Extracts system messages to separate field
  - Handles image base64 encoding (Anthropic doesn't support URLs)
  - Adds required headers
- **to_gemini_format()**: Converts UnifiedRequest → Gemini format
  - Converts to contents/parts structure
  - Maps "assistant" role to "model"
  - Handles system instructions separately

Also includes **detect_provider()** which auto-detects the provider from model name.

#### 3. Client Implementation (`client.py`)

The **UnifiedLLMClient** class provides:

- Automatic provider detection and routing
- Direct HTTP calls using httpx (no SDK dependencies)
- Both regular and streaming generation methods
- Consistent error handling across providers

### What the Dev Needs to Complete

1. **Error Handling Enhancement**

   - Add retry logic for transient failures
   - Create unified error types for common failures
   - Better error messages for missing API keys

2. **Image Handling**

   - Implement URL → base64 conversion for Anthropic
   - Add image download capability for Gemini non-GCS URLs
   - Validate image formats and sizes

3. **Testing Infrastructure**

   - Create live test suite that runs same prompts on all providers
   - Add integration tests for streaming
   - Test multimodal capabilities
   - Add environment variable validation

4. **Additional Features**

   - Tool/function calling support (not in prototype)
   - Token counting utilities
   - Cost estimation based on usage
   - Response caching capabilities

5. **Production Readiness**
   - Add proper logging throughout
   - Implement connection pooling for httpx
   - Add timeout configuration
   - Support for proxy settings

### Target Usage Examples

```python
# Unified access (portable across providers)
from llmgine.orchestrator import UnifiedLLMClient
from llmgine.unified.models import UnifiedRequest, UnifiedMessage

client = UnifiedLLMClient()
request = UnifiedRequest(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",  # or "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" or "gemini-2.5-flash"
    messages=[UnifiedMessage(role="user", content="Explain quantum computing")],
    max_tokens=500
)
response = await client.generate(request)
print(response.content)

# Direct provider access (all features)
from llmgine.providers.openai import OpenAIClient

openai = OpenAIClient()
response = await openai.chat_completion(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}],
    max_tokens=500,
    tools=[...],  # Provider-specific features available
    response_format={"type": "json_object"}
)

# Mixed usage
from llmgine.providers.anthropic import AnthropicClient
from llmgine.providers.anthropic.adapter import AnthropicAdapter
from llmgine.unified.models import UnifiedRequest

# Use unified format but get provider-specific response
anthropic = AnthropicClient()
adapter = AnthropicAdapter()
unified_req = UnifiedRequest(...)
anthropic_req = adapter.to_provider_request(unified_req)
response = await anthropic.messages(anthropic_req)
```

### Architecture Principles

1. **Unified Models First**: Define the ideal provider-agnostic data structures
2. **Provider Isolation**: Each provider module is completely self-contained
3. **Adapter Responsibility**: Adapters handle ALL conversion logic between unified and provider formats
4. **Direct Access**: Provider clients expose the FULL API, not limited to unified features
5. **Orchestrator Simplicity**: The orchestrator just routes to providers via adapters
6. **Extensibility**: New providers just add a folder - no changes to existing code
7. **Type Safety**: Use provider-specific types internally, unified types at boundaries
8. **Testing Strategy**: Test adapters with unit tests, clients with integration tests
