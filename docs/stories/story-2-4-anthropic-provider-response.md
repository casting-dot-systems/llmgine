# Story 2.4: Anthropic Provider Response Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** LLMgine developer,
**I want** comprehensive response handling for Anthropic that validates all syntax variations and preserves all API-specific data,
**So that** users can access Anthropic-specific features with confidence that all response types are properly parsed

## Refined Focus
This story focuses on syntax validation testing - ensuring we can properly parse and handle all response types from Anthropic Claude models:
- **claude-3-5-haiku-20241022** - Used for all normal operations (fast, efficient)
- **claude-sonnet-4-20250514** - Used specifically for testing thinking mode syntax

**Update**: As per user request, we've removed claude-3-opus and old sonnet models. Only Haiku is used for normal operations, and Claude 4 Sonnet is used exclusively for testing thinking syntax.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Deep research of Anthropic API documentation completed
2. ✅ Syntax test cases defined for Claude models
3. ✅ Basic response structure validated for all models
4. ✅ Model-specific features tested (system prompts, stop sequences)
5. ✅ Tool calling response structures validated (single, multiple, parallel)
6. ✅ Streaming response parsing validated (SSE format)
7. ✅ Response format variations tested (including multi-turn conversations)
8. ✅ Error response structures validated
9. ✅ All response fields properly mapped and accessible
10. ✅ Implementation handles all syntax variations correctly

## Focused Syntax Test Cases

### Test Case Matrix (12 total API calls)

| Test # | Model | Key Parameters | What We're Testing |
|--------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | claude-3-5-haiku | Basic call | Base response structure |
| 2 | claude-sonnet-4 | thinking mode | Thinking content blocks |
| 3 | claude-3-5-haiku | system prompt | System message handling |
| 4 | claude-3-5-haiku | stop_sequences=[".", "!"] | Stop sequence behavior |
| 5 | claude-3-5-haiku | Single tool definition | Basic tool calling |
| 6 | claude-3-5-haiku | Multiple tools | Multiple tool response |
| 7 | claude-3-5-haiku | Multi-turn conversation | Context handling |
| 8 | claude-3-5-haiku | stream=true | SSE streaming chunks |
| 9 | claude-3-5-haiku | Invalid parameter | Error response structure |
| 10 | claude-3-5-haiku | max_tokens=4096 | Long response handling |
| 11 | claude-3-5-haiku | Tool with tool_choice | Forced tool calling |
| 12 | claude-sonnet-4 | thinking + tools | Interleaved thinking |

### Response Fields to Validate

#### Standard Fields (All Responses)
- id, type, role, model
- content[] with type and text
- stop_reason, stop_sequence
- usage with input_tokens, output_tokens

#### Anthropic-Specific Fields
- **Message structure**: Multi-block content support
- **Stop handling**: stop_reason variations ("end_turn", "stop_sequence", "max_tokens")
- **System fingerprint**: When present

#### Tool Response Fields
- content[] with type="tool_use", id, name, input
- Tool result handling in subsequent messages

#### Streaming Fields
- SSE event types: message_start, content_block_start, content_block_delta, etc.
- Proper event aggregation
- Usage tracking in message_stop event

## Dev Notes

### Testing Implementation
```python
# Focused test cases - NOT permutations
test_cases = [
    {
        "test_id": "test_1_haiku_basic",
        "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
        "params": {
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello"}],
            "max_tokens": 10
        }
    },
    {
        "test_id": "test_4_sonnet_system",
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        "params": {
            "system": "You are a helpful assistant.",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who are you?"}],
            "max_tokens": 50
        }
    },
    {
        "test_id": "test_5_haiku_stop_sequences",
        "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
        "params": {
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Count to ten"}],
            "stop_sequences": [".", "!"],
            "max_tokens": 100
        }
    }
    # ... other specific test cases
]
```

### Response Storage Format
Each test should store:
- Request parameters
- Raw response
- Response metadata (headers, timing)
- Test identifier
- Model version
- Timestamp

Responses are stored in:
- tests/providers/response/stored_responses/claude-3-5-haiku/ (for Haiku model responses)
- tests/providers/response/stored_responses/claude-3-5-sonnet/ (for Sonnet model responses)
- tests/providers/response/stored_responses/claude-3-opus/ (for Opus model responses)
- tests/providers/response/stored_responses/anthropic_validation_summary.json (test results summary)

### Relevant Source Tree
- `src/llmgine/llm/providers/anthropic.py` - Current Anthropic implementation
- `src/llmgine/llm/models/anthropic.py` - Anthropic model wrapper
- `tests/fixtures/anthropic/` - Existing test fixtures
- `docs/providers/anthropic.md` - Provider documentation

### Architecture Notes
- Must integrate with Response Recording Framework from Story 2.1
- Should extend base models from Story 2.2
- Handle Anthropic's SSE streaming format properly
- Consider Anthropic's unique message role system

### Key Validation Points
1. **Response Structure**: Validate presence and types of all fields
2. **Model Variations**: Ensure all Claude models return consistent structure
3. **Content Blocks**: Validate multi-part content handling
4. **Tool Response**: Validate tool_use content blocks when present
5. **Streaming**: Ensure SSE events aggregate to complete response
6. **Error Format**: Validate error response structure matches Anthropic format

### Implementation Focus
- This is about SYNTAX validation, not performance testing
- Use stored responses to avoid repeated API calls
- Focus on response parsing and field mapping
- Ensure all response variations are handled
- Content blocks must be properly parsed (text, tool_use)

### Anthropic-Specific Considerations
1. **Content Block Types**:
   ```python
   # Text content
   {"type": "text", "text": "Hello"}
   
   # Tool use content
   {"type": "tool_use", "id": "...", "name": "function", "input": {...}}
   ```

2. **Stop Reasons**:
   - "end_turn" - Natural completion
   - "stop_sequence" - Hit stop sequence
   - "max_tokens" - Hit token limit
   - "tool_use" - Calling a tool

3. **SSE Event Types**:
   - message_start
   - content_block_start
   - content_block_delta
   - content_block_stop
   - message_delta
   - message_stop

4. **Error Response Format**:
   ```python
   {
       "type": "error",
       "error": {
           "type": "invalid_request_error",
           "message": "..."
       }
   }
   ```
