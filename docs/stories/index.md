# llmgine MVP Completion Stories

This directory contains the individual story documents for completing the llmgine MVP as defined in the Brownfield PRD.

## Epic 1: Complete Production-Ready MVP with Standalone Observability

The stories are designed to be implemented in sequence, with each building on the previous:

### Core Infrastructure
1. [Story 1.1: Implement Standalone Observability Module](./story-1-1-opentelemetry-handler.md)
   - Separate observability from message bus
   - Includes OpenTelemetry integration
   - Critical for avoiding circular dependencies

2. [Story 1.2: Enhance Message Bus Robustness](./story-1-2-enhance-message-bus.md)
   - Production-grade error recovery
   - Backpressure and performance guarantees
   - Foundation for scalable applications

3. [Story 1.3: Observability Code-Level Improvements](./story-1-3-observability-improvements.md)
   - Performance optimizations for observability
   - Fix memory leaks and event loop issues
   - Add configurable sampling

### Quality Assurance
4. [Story 1.4: Comprehensive Test Coverage - Core Components with Performance](./story-1-4-test-coverage-core.md)
   - Message bus and observability testing
   - Performance benchmarks (10k events/sec)
   - Chaos and stress testing

5. [Story 1.5: Comprehensive Test Coverage - Providers and Tools](./story-1-5-test-coverage-providers.md)
   - Provider and tool system testing
   - Should include tests for 1.3 if completed

### Documentation and Integration
6. [Story 1.6: Final Integration and Documentation](./story-1-6-documentation-integration.md)
   - Brings everything together
   - Must be done last

### Additional Enhancements
7. [Story 1.7: Implement Async Observability Queue](./story-1-7-async-observability-queue.md)
   - Non-blocking observability with queue pattern
   - Maintains existing API compatibility
   - Builds on story 1.3 improvements

8. [Story 1.8: Standardize LLM Request Contract](./story-1-8-standardize-llm-contract.md)
   - Unified provider interface
   - Can be done in parallel with other stories

## Implementation Notes

- Each story is designed to be completed independently by an AI agent
- Stories include all necessary context and technical details
- Integration verification ensures existing functionality remains intact
- Test coverage is emphasized throughout to achieve production quality

## Success Metrics

- 100% of original PRD requirements implemented
- >80% test coverage on core components
- Message bus handles 10,000+ events/second with <10ms p99 latency
- Graceful degradation under extreme load without data loss
- Zero circular dependencies in observability
- All examples updated and working
- Documentation enables <10 minute quick start
- Zero breaking changes to existing APIs

## Performance Requirements

The enhanced message bus must meet these performance targets:
- **Throughput**: 10,000+ events/second sustained
- **Latency**: <10ms p99 for event publishing
- **Reliability**: Zero data loss under normal operations
- **Scalability**: Linear performance up to 100k events/second
- **Recovery**: <1 second recovery from handler failures
