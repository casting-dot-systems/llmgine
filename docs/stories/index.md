## Development Process

Each story follows a consistent structure:
1. **User Story**: Clear statement of who, what, and why
2. **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable requirements
3. **Technical Details**: Implementation guidance
4. **Tasks/Subtasks**: Breakdown of work
5. **Dev Notes**: Important considerations
6. **QA Results**: Quality assurance findings

Stories are designed to be:
- Self-contained with all necessary context
- Implementable by AI agents
- Testable and verifiable
- Backward compatible
