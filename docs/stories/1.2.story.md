# Story 1.2: Enhance Message Bus Robustness

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** platform engineer,
**I want** a production-grade message bus with error recovery and performance guarantees,
**so that** I can build reliable applications that scale under load.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement error recovery mechanisms for handler failures
2. Add backpressure handling to prevent queue overflow
3. Create dead letter queue for unprocessable events
4. Add circuit breaker pattern for failing handlers
5. Implement event prioritization and queue management
6. Add comprehensive logging and metrics for bus operations
7. Create performance benchmarks targeting 10k events/sec

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement Error Recovery Mechanisms (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create ResilientMessageBus class extending MessageBus in src/llmgine/bus/resilience.py
  - [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed command handlers
  - [ ] Add dead letter queue (asyncio.Queue) for events that exceed max retries
  - [ ] Create error tracking data structures to monitor handler failures
  - [ ] Write unit tests for retry mechanism and dead letter queue behavior
- [ ] Task 2: Add Backpressure Handling (AC: 2, 5)
  - [ ] Create BoundedEventQueue class in src/llmgine/bus/backpressure.py
  - [ ] Implement queue size monitoring with high water mark detection
  - [ ] Add backpressure strategies (drop oldest, reject new, adaptive rate limiting)
  - [ ] Integrate bounded queue into MessageBus._event_queue
  - [ ] Write tests for queue overflow scenarios and backpressure activation
- [ ] Task 3: Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create CircuitBreaker class with states: CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
  - [ ] Add circuit breakers dictionary in ResilientMessageBus for per-handler tracking
  - [ ] Implement failure threshold detection and circuit opening logic
  - [ ] Add half-open state with test request handling
  - [ ] Write unit tests for circuit breaker state transitions
- [ ] Task 4: Add Performance Monitoring and Metrics (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Create src/llmgine/bus/metrics.py with metric collection infrastructure
  - [ ] Implement counters: events_published_total, events_processed_total, events_failed_total
  - [ ] Add histograms: event_processing_duration_seconds
  - [ ] Implement gauges: queue_size, backpressure_active, circuit_breaker_state, dead_letter_queue_size
  - [ ] Integrate metrics collection into bus operations without performance impact
  - [ ] Write tests verifying metric accuracy
- [ ] Task 5: Create Performance Benchmarks (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Create benchmarks/bus_performance.py with benchmark suite
  - [ ] Implement sustained throughput test targeting 10k events/sec
  - [ ] Add latency measurement for p50, p95, p99 percentiles
  - [ ] Create memory usage tracking under sustained load
  - [ ] Add chaos testing scenarios with random handler failures
  - [ ] Document performance baseline and optimization recommendations
- [ ] Task 6: Integration and Backwards Compatibility (IV: 1-4)
  - [ ] Update MessageBus to optionally use resilience features
  - [ ] Ensure all existing tests pass without modification
  - [ ] Add feature flags for enabling/disabling resilience features
  - [ ] Create migration guide for adopting new features
  - [ ] Run full integration test suite with resilience enabled

## Dev Notes

### Current Implementation Context
The message bus is implemented as a singleton in `src/llmgine/bus/bus.py` [Source: codebase inspection]. Key implementation details:
- Uses asyncio.Queue for event processing
- Maintains separate handler registries per session ID
- Integrates with ObservabilityManager for event tracking
- Current implementation has no error recovery or backpressure handling

### Project Structure
Based on the existing codebase structure:
- Bus implementation: `src/llmgine/bus/` directory
- New files should follow pattern: `src/llmgine/bus/{feature}.py`
- Tests location: `tests/unit/bus/` (create if doesn't exist)
- Benchmarks: `benchmarks/` directory at project root

### Integration Points
From Story 1.1 context: The observability module is now standalone and doesn't use the message bus for its own events. This means:
- Metrics collection can safely use ObservabilityManager without circular dependencies
- Performance monitoring won't create feedback loops
- Dead letter queue events should be observable but not re-enter the bus

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.11+ required (from pyproject.toml)
- Must maintain async/await patterns throughout
- Use asyncio primitives (Queue, Event, Lock) for concurrency
- Follow existing type hints and strict typing patterns

### Testing Standards
Based on existing test patterns in `tests/test_bus_session.py`:
- Use pytest-asyncio for async test support
- Clean bus state between tests using fixtures
- Test files follow pattern: `test_{feature}.py`
- Use pytest.mark.asyncio for async tests
- Fixtures should handle bus lifecycle (start/stop)

### Performance Requirements
Specific targets from acceptance criteria:
- Throughput: 10,000+ events/second sustained
- Latency: <10ms p99 for event publishing
- Memory: Bounded memory usage under load
- CPU: Linear scaling with event rate
