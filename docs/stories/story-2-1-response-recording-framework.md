# Story 2.1: Response Recording Framework

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** LLMgine developer,
**I want** a ResponseRecorder class that captures complete provider responses,
**so that** I can preserve all provider-specific data while maintaining the unified interface

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ResponseRecorder captures 100% of provider response data before any transformation
2. Recording happens asynchronously without blocking the main response flow
3. Recorder supports all three providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
4. Recorded data includes timestamps, session IDs, and request metadata
5. System gracefully handles recording failures without affecting main flow
6. Configuration allows disabling recording for performance-critical paths
7. Memory usage remains bounded even under high load
8. Integration points are clearly defined and documented

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design ResponseRecorder interface (AC: 1, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Define abstract base class with core methods
  - [ ] Create data structures for recorded responses
  - [ ] Design configuration system for recorder settings
- [ ] Implement core ResponseRecorder class (AC: 1, 2, 5)
  - [ ] Create async recording mechanism
  - [ ] Implement error handling and fallback logic
  - [ ] Add memory management and buffering
- [ ] Integrate with provider implementations (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Modify OpenAIModel to use recorder
  - [ ] Modify AnthropicModel to use recorder
  - [ ] Modify GeminiModel to use recorder
- [ ] Add configuration system (AC: 6, 7)
  - [ ] Create configuration schema
  - [ ] Implement enable/disable logic
  - [ ] Add memory limits and buffer settings
- [ ] Create observability hooks (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Add recording events to message bus
  - [ ] Implement metrics collection
  - [ ] Create debug logging

## Dev Notes

### Testing
- Test file location: `tests/llm/response_recorder/`
- Test standards: Follow existing pytest-asyncio patterns
- Testing frameworks: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock
- Specific requirements:
  - Test async recording behavior
  - Verify zero data loss with mock responses
  - Test memory limits and buffer overflow
  - Validate error handling doesn't affect main flow
  - Performance benchmarks for recording overhead

### Relevant Source Tree
Based on the current architecture, the ResponseRecorder will integrate with:
- `src/llmgine/llm/models/` - Provider model implementations
- `src/llmgine/llm/providers/` - Provider interfaces
- `src/llmgine/bus/` - Message bus for events
- `src/llmgine/messages/` - Event definitions

### Architecture Notes
- The ResponseRecorder must follow the existing pattern of using Pydantic models for data validation
- Integration should use the existing message bus for emitting recording events
- Must maintain compatibility with the streaming response pattern used by providers
- Should leverage existing session management from the bus system

### Implementation Details
1. **ResponseRecorder Base Class**:
   ```python
   class ResponseRecorder(ABC):
       async def record_response(
           self,
           provider: str,
           raw_response: Any,
           request_metadata: Dict[str, Any],
           session_id: str
       ) -> None:
           """Record a provider response asynchronously"""
   ```

2. **Integration Points**:
   - Hook into provider models after receiving response but before transformation
   - Use existing LLMResponse models as reference for unified format
   - Emit ResponseRecorded events through the message bus

3. **Configuration Schema**:
   ```python
   class ResponseRecorderConfig(BaseModel):
       enabled: bool = True
       max_memory_mb: int = 100
       buffer_size: int = 1000
       providers: List[str] = ["openai", "anthropic", "gemini"]
   ```

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Use bounded queues for buffering responses
   - Implement automatic flushing when buffer reaches limits
   - Consider using memory-mapped files for large responses
