# llmgine Unified Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

This document combines the original PRD vision with brownfield analysis insights and updated project scope based on completed work. The llmgine project has successfully implemented core infrastructure (Stories 1.1-1.2) and is now focusing on creating a unified LLM interface as the next critical milestone.

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create a resilient, production-grade application library for building LLM applications
- Provide a stable "runtime spine" that handles essential services like observability, component communication, and tool management
- Enable a plug-and-play architecture where LLM frameworks and services can be treated as modular adapters
- **NEW**: Establish a unified LLM interface that allows seamless provider switching without code changes
- Ensure the developer experience is paramount, enabling startup teams to move from concept to production with confidence

### Background Context

Developers building LLM applications currently face a difficult choice: either build all the application scaffolding from scratch or get locked into a single, opinionated framework. This framework lock-in makes it difficult to adapt to new tools and technologies, and often leads to brittle applications that are hard to scale and maintain.

`llmgine` solves this by providing the durable application layer that is often missing. By offering a decoupled, event-driven architecture with first-class observability and unified data contracts, it allows developers to focus on their unique business logic while retaining the flexibility to use any LLM provider or framework on top.

### Current Implementation Status

The project has successfully completed:
- âœ… **Core Infrastructure**: Message bus with session management, resilience features, and production-grade performance (12,553 events/sec)
- âœ… **Observability System**: Standalone module with OpenTelemetry integration, avoiding circular dependencies
- ðŸ”„ **In Progress**: Unified LLM interface for provider abstraction

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Platform (Completed)
1. **FR1** âœ…: The library provides a session-based, asynchronous `MessageBus` component for dispatching `Command` and `Event` objects
2. **FR2** âœ…: The library has production-grade resilience features including error recovery, backpressure handling, and circuit breakers
3. **FR3** âœ…: The library includes a standalone observability module with OpenTelemetry support

#### Unified LLM Interface (Current Focus)
4. **FR4** ðŸ”„: The library must define unified `LLMRequest` and `LLMResponse` contracts that all providers implement
5. **FR5** ðŸ”„: All LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) must implement a common interface
6. **FR6** ðŸ”„: Provider-specific features must remain accessible through extension mechanisms
7. **FR7** ðŸ”„: Tool and context managers must work seamlessly with the unified interface

#### Future Requirements (Backlog)
8. **FR8** ðŸ“‹: Comprehensive test coverage (>80%) for all core components
9. **FR9** ðŸ“‹: Advanced tool registration with automatic schema generation
10. **FR10** ðŸ“‹: Persistent context stores with database backends

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR1**: The library's core components are architected in a modular, plug-and-play fashion
2. **NFR2**: The observability system is compatible with the OpenTelemetry protocol
3. **NFR3**: All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing implementations
4. **NFR4**: The message bus handles 10,000+ events/second with <10ms p99 latency
5. **NFR5**: Python 3.11+ with strict typing (MyPy) and code quality standards (Ruff)
6. **NFR6**: Performance must not degrade when adding new features

## Technical Architecture

### Repository Structure
- **Type**: Monorepo managed with `uv`
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Structure**:
  ```
  src/llmgine/
    â”œâ”€â”€ bus/           # Message bus with resilience features
    â”œâ”€â”€ messages/      # Unified contracts and data models
    â”œâ”€â”€ observability/ # Standalone observability with OTel
    â”œâ”€â”€ llm/          # LLM providers and interfaces
    â”œâ”€â”€ tools/        # Tool management system
    â””â”€â”€ bootstrap.py  # Application initialization
  ```

### Service Architecture
- **Pattern**: Modular, Event-Driven with Message Bus at core
- **Scoping**: Two-level (Bus-level persistent, Session-level auto-cleanup)
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retry logic, dead letter queues
- **Observability**: Pluggable handlers with OpenTelemetry support

### Performance Characteristics
- **Throughput**: 12,553 events/second achieved (exceeds 10k target)
- **Latency**: 0.219ms p99 (well under 10ms target)
- **Memory**: Bounded with backpressure handling
- **Scalability**: Linear with event rate
